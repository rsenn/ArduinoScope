Here are exampe Arduino code that must be downloaded before launching the application:

- `DummyDuino`: Send data on serial bus, useful if you don't have any sensors plugged to the Arduino.
- `thermocouples`: 1, 2 or 3 thermocouples.

:warning: You MUST set up the application to receive the right number of data!
